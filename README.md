# EC_Classifier_Base
Implementation of Epistemic Classifiers
GE Research - Machine Learning

1) Start with the ‘Sample_code_epsilon_vs_performance.ipynb’ code. 
2) Specifically, if you already have a classifier (‘model’ in the notebook), then you may construct an instance of an Epistemic Classifier with it using the EpistemicClassiifer() call with reference to the layer(s) you want to use for generating support and an appropriate distance metric specified, as shown in the notebook. 
3) You may invoke predict() on either your training data or test data to get labels, including the ‘IK’, ‘IMK’, and ‘IDK’ labels.
4) Additionally, the notebook shows the functions you may use to plot the new confusion matrix as well as how the accuracy and coverage behave as a function of various values of epsilon.
